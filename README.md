# FinexaGPT: Transformer Implementation
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
A clean, readable GPT implementation that actually makes sense. No magic, no bloat - just the transformer architecture you can understand in an afternoon.

# ⚡ What This Is
A minimal GPT-like transformer implementation

134M parameter model (like a tiny GPT-2)

Clean code you can actually read

Production-ready data pipeline

Everything fits in one file (almost)

# 🎯 Why FinexaGPT?

While there are many transformer implementations, FinexaGPT is:
- **Financial-domain ready** (optimized for earnings calls, SEC filings, market data)
- **Actually readable** (most implementations are abstracted into oblivion)
- **Built for extension** (clean architecture for adding financial-specific features)

# 🚀 What This Is NOT
❌ Not a 1-trillion parameter model

❌ Not a framework with 1000 dependencies

❌ Not abstracted into oblivion

❌ Not pretending to be something it's not

🎯 Quick Start
1. Install
bash
git clone https://github.com/franciskamande-ai/FinexaGPT.git
cd FinexaGPT
pip install torch tiktoken omegaconf
2. Train
bash
# Get some text
echo "Hello world! This is training data." > data.txt

# Train (30 seconds on CPU)
python train.py --data data.txt --max-steps 100
3. Generate
python
from model import Transformer

model = Transformer(vocab_size=50000)
# Load checkpoint
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("checkpoint.pt"))

output = model.generate(
    idx=torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3]]),  # Your tokens
    max_new_tokens=50,
    temperature=0.8
)
print(output)
🧠 The Model (model.py)
python
# What you get:
#### - Multi-head attention with causal masking
#### - Feed-forward networks (GELU)
#### - Layer normalization & dropout
#### - Learned positional embeddings
#### - Next-token prediction
#### - Temperature/top-k sampling

# What's TODO (help wanted!):
#### - GQA (Grouped Query Attention)
#### - Flash Attention optimization  
#### - RMSNorm instead of LayerNorm
#### - Rotary positional embeddings
#### - SwiGLU activation
# 📊 Specs
Parameters: 134M (configurable)

Context: 512 tokens (extendable)

Layers: 12

Heads: 12

Embedding: 768-dim

Vocab: 50K (tiktoken's cl100k_base)

# 🔧 Configuration
yaml
# config.yaml (simple, not overwhelming)
model:
  num_layers: 12
  num_heads: 12  
  d_model: 768
  vocab_size: 50000
  max_seq_length: 512
  
training:
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 3e-4
  warmup_steps: 2000
  total_steps: 100000
# 🤝 Want to Help?
See the TODO in model.py:

GQA - Grouped Query Attention (memory efficient) ==> Done

Flash Attention - Faster attention computation ==> Done

RMSNorm - Better than LayerNorm ==> Done

RoPE - Rotary positional embeddings ==> Done

SwiGLU - Better activation function ==> Done

Model Parallelism

# ❓ FAQ
Q: Can this beat GPT-4?
A: No. It's 134M params vs 1.7T. This is for learning.

Q: Why not use HuggingFace?
A: This is for understanding, not just using.

Q: What GPU do I need?
A: Trains on a single GPU (8GB+ VRAM). Runs on CPU (slowly).

Q: Is this production ready?
A: The code is clean and works. Add your own monitoring/CI.

# 📈 Performance
Training: ~500 tokens/sec on RTX 3090

Memory: ~3GB for 134M model

Accuracy: Learns language patterns (not SOTA)

# 🎓 Learning Path
