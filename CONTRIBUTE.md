# 🤔 Why Contribute to FinexaGPT?
Because we're building something REAL - not another toy project. We're bridging the gap between Finance and AI in Africa, and we need YOUR help.

# The Problem:
African financial data is underrepresented in AI models

GPTs trained on Western data fail on African financial contexts

Building African AI is expensive (compute costs $$$)

Most "open" projects are actually Western-focused

# Our Solution:
A GPT specifically tuned for African financial contexts - understanding local markets, regulations, currencies (KES, NGN, ZAR), and economic patterns.

# 💰 The Hard Truth About Costs
What	Cost	Why It Matters
Training 130M model	~$3,000	Just for BASE model (no fine-tuning)
Fine-tuning on African data	~$5,000	GPU time + data collection
Larger model (1B params)	~$50,000+	Production-grade performance
Monthly inference hosting	~$2,000	Keeping it available 24/7
We're not asking for charity - we're asking for investment in African AI infrastructure.

# 🎯 How Your Contribution Helps
💰 Financial Contributions:
text
$5    --> 1 hour GPU time
$10   --> 2 hours of GPU time
$50    → 10 hours of GPU time
$250   → Fine-tuning dataset collection
$1,000 → 1 month of cloud training
$5,000 → Major architecture upgrade
# Where the money goes:

70% → Cloud compute (AWS/Azure/GCP credits)

20% → Data collection (African financial texts)

10% → Infrastructure (CI/CD, hosting)

# 👨‍💻 Code Contributions:
Priority 1: Performance (Save us $$$)

python
# TODO in model.py - each saves compute costs:
1. Flash Attention - 30% faster training
2. GQA (Grouped Query Attention) - 40% less memory
3. Model parallelism - use multiple GPUs efficiently
4. Quantization - cheaper inference
Priority 2: African Financial Features

python
1. African currency tokenizer (KES, NGN, ZAR, GHS, etc.)
2. Local financial document parsers (CBK reports, NSE filings)
3. Multilingual support (Swahili, Yoruba, Amharic + English)
4. Regulatory compliance layers
Priority 3: Production Ready

python
1. API server with rate limiting
2. Monitoring & logging
3. Security audit
4. Deployment scripts

✊ Why This Matters
Every dollar contributed trains a model that:

✅ Understands African financial contexts

✅ Speaks African languages

✅ Respects African privacy norms

✅ Serves African businesses first

We're not just building another AI model. We're building African AI sovereignty.
